### **Product Requirements Document: Responsive Product Comparison Table**

**1. Overview**

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a responsive product comparison table on the existing project. The table will allow users to easily compare the features of different products. The design will be responsive, adapting its layout for optimal viewing on various screen sizes, from large desktops to mobile devices. This implementation will utilize placeholder content and be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging existing styling where possible.

**2. Visual Design & Key Features**

The comparison table will be designed based on the provided image for larger breakpoints.

- **Layout:** The table will be full-width of the viewport, with a `max-width` to ensure readability when all product columns are visible.
- **Inclusions List:** A static list of features (inclusions) will be displayed in the first column on the left.
- **Product Columns:** To the right of the inclusions list, columns for each product will be displayed. The top of each column will feature the product's name and a call-to-action button, styled similarly to the existing product carousel.
- **Carousel Functionality:** A maximum of three product columns will be shown at once. Controls will be provided to navigate to the next set of products, mirroring the functionality of the carousel that will be positioned above this table.
- **Feature Indicators:** The body of the table will use ticks (✓) and crosses (✗) to indicate whether a product includes a specific feature.
- **Dynamic Product Data:** The product names and their corresponding feature data displayed in the table will be synchronized with the products shown in the existing carousel above it.

**3. Responsive Behavior**

The table's layout will adapt to different screen sizes:

- **Large Screens (Desktops):** Displays the inclusions list and up to three product columns.
- **Medium Screens (Tablets):** The number of visible product columns will reduce to two.
- **Small Screens (Mobile):** Only one product column will be visible at a time. The layout will be adjusted so that each inclusion is stacked vertically. The product's feature indicator (tick or cross) will appear directly below the corresponding inclusion text.

**Example of Mobile Layout:**

[Inclusion 1 ]
[Product A: ✓]

[Inclusion 2 ]
[Product A: ✓]

...and so on.

**4. Implementation Phases**

The development will be broken down into the following phases:

---

### **Phase 1: HTML Structure & Basic Desktop Styling**

**Objective:** Create the core HTML structure and apply basic CSS to match the desktop view provided in the image.

**Tasks:**

1.  **HTML Scaffolding:**
    - Create a `<table>` element with a `<thead>` for product names and buttons, and a `<tbody>` for the feature list.
    - The first column in the `<tbody>` will contain the list of inclusions (e.g., "Smart scheduling", "Flexible holds").
    - Subsequent columns will be for the products.
    - Use placeholder text for all content.
2.  **Basic CSS Styling:**
    - Apply full-width styling with a `max-width` for the table.
    - Style the header row with product names and buttons, referencing existing styles from the product carousel.
    - Style the inclusions list column.
    - Ensure basic alignment and spacing are consistent with the design.

**Testing:**

- Verify that the table structure renders correctly in a desktop browser.
- Confirm that all placeholder content for inclusions, product names, and buttons is present.
- Check that the table spans the full width of the viewport and adheres to the `max-width`.

### **Phase 2: Responsive Layout for Tablet and Mobile**

**Objective:** Implement CSS media queries to make the table responsive for tablet and mobile screen sizes.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Tablet View (Two Columns):**
    - Write a media query for medium screen sizes.
    - Within this query, adjust the CSS to hide all but two product columns.
2.  **Mobile View (Single Column & Stacked Layout):**
    - Write a media query for small screen sizes.
    - Adjust the CSS to show only one product column.
    - Restructure the layout to the stacked format described in the requirements: each inclusion on its own row, followed by a row with the product's corresponding tick/cross.

**Testing:**

- Resize the browser window or use browser developer tools to simulate tablet and mobile devices.
- Confirm that the table layout correctly switches to two product columns on tablet-sized screens.
- Confirm that the table layout correctly switches to the single-column, stacked format on mobile-sized screens.
- Ensure the content remains readable and well-organized in all views.

### **Phase 3: Carousel Controls for Product Columns**

**Objective:** Implement JavaScript to allow users to navigate through the product columns.

**Tasks:**

1.  **HTML for Controls:**
    - Add "next" and "previous" arrow buttons to the UI.
2.  **JavaScript Logic:**
    - Write JavaScript to handle clicks on the navigation arrows.
    - This script will show/hide the appropriate product columns to simulate a carousel effect.
    - The logic should handle the display of a maximum of three products at a time on desktop, two on tablet, and one on mobile.

**Testing:**

- On a desktop view, click the "next" arrow to see the next set of products and the "previous" arrow to go back.
- Verify that the carousel navigation works as expected on tablet and mobile views, adjusting for the number of visible columns.
- Ensure the controls are disabled when there are no more products to show in a given direction.

---

### **Phase 4: Dynamic Content and Feature Indicators**

**Objective:** Populate the table with actual data and replace placeholders with ticks and crosses.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Integrate Ticks and Crosses:**
    - Replace the placeholder content in the table cells with tick (✓) and cross (✗) icons or characters.
2.  **Synchronize with Product Carousel:**
    - Write JavaScript to dynamically update the product names in the comparison table to match the products currently visible in the main carousel above it.
    - Ensure the feature data (ticks/crosses) corresponds to the correct product being displayed.

**Testing:**

- Verify that all data cells correctly display either a tick or a cross.
- Confirm that the product names in the comparison table header are identical to the names in the main product carousel.
- As the main carousel changes, ensure the comparison table updates its product columns accordingly.

This phased approach will ensure a structured and testable implementation of the responsive product comparison table.
